# SocialCrud  

A API/webservice to create, read, update, delete using Django, a python framework simple to use and fully of functionality like ORM/DRM and rest-framework to APIs.  

some path:  
homepage/ - web  
login/   - web   
users/  - api ( users )  
home/  - api ( posts )  

this is a personal project made to pass in careear process in backend nd webdev, I dont like the result but sometimes we have to accept that the process is infinity nd if I continue to polished this I never will complet until the end.  

## Some features  

Authentication with Token, Sessions and BasicAuth  
A homepage to see posts and create posts.    
A login page.  
Most part of the front/webpage is poor and not work well, just the basic. but the backend is on.
